# AI_Projects


These small projects are projects that I did while I took my Artificial Intelligence class.

Eliza.py 

For this project, I created a chat box bot using REGEX. The bot will ask you questions on how you are feeling, personal/family questions, why you are feeling a certain a way and more.

8-queens.py

This project solves the 8 queenâ€™s problem using steepest ascent Hill Climbing and random restart hill climbing. You must enter the amount of times you want the program to solve the problem and it will output certain information such as if it was able to solve it.

Ex:
8-queens.py 5
